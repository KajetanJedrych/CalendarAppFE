## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This is a frontend project developed as part of a university course to explore and gain hands-on experience with modern web technologies. The application is built using React for its component-based architecture and TailwindCSS for efficient and utility-first styling.

The main objectives of this project are:

To deepen understanding of React and its ecosystem.
To learn and apply TailwindCSS for styling web applications.
To design and implement a functional user interface in a professional, modern style.
This project serves as both a learning experience and a practical demonstration of integrating these technologies into a real-world application.
